# Release Readiness Report

This document records the `ASE-46` strict-closeout synchronization refresh of release readiness for `svelte-streamdown`.

Audit date: `2026-04-06`

## What Changed Since The Prior Audit

- The reviewed `master` head advanced from `850b5ab5f3f1d7a99aa44fb0ca1d6f168f282d84` to `7ef35ae4a6f992ccd454b2233ae7ca70fb64dedf`.
- The strict-closeout tree is now fully landed on `master`:
  - `ASE-47` merged at `origin/master@e96fa39`
  - `ASE-45` merged at `origin/master@d6cbee9`
  - the umbrella cleanup sync merged at `origin/master@0e0aaea`
  - `ASE-48` merged at `origin/master@7ef35ae`
- The exact reviewed head now has fresh green repo-hosted CI evidence:
  - push run `24024875608` completed successfully on `2026-04-06`
- The exact reviewed head now also has fresh green repo-hosted Release workflow evidence:
  - push run `24024875591` completed successfully on `2026-04-06`
  - `prepare-release`, `publish-with-provenance`, and `post-publish-verify` all completed successfully
  - actual npm publish and tag creation were intentionally skipped because this was a push run, not `workflow_dispatch` with `publish=true`
- The latest repo-hosted nightly parity run is green, but it now predates the strict-closeout head:
  - `Nightly Full Parity` run `24020166592` completed successfully on `2026-04-06`
  - that green nightly run reviewed commit `833200338632d68029b5a25b1898ecd48b173e1d`
  - `git diff --name-only 8332003..7ef35ae` now includes parser, rendering, and parity-test changes from the strict-closeout branch, so the nightly evidence is no longer exact-head coverage for the reviewed release candidate
- The migration tracker now fully closes the former partial backlog:
  - `docs/test-migration-status.md` now reports `57` files passing via ported upstream file, `12` with documented port gaps, and `16` via local analogue only
  - the remaining unresolved inventory is down to `0` partial files, `0` missing files, `16` blocked files, and `0` remaining `P0` files not yet passing via a ported upstream file or local analogue
- The parity and platform closeout mappings now align with the landed evidence:
  - `docs/parity-matrix.md` leaves no `tracked_follow_up` or `missing` rows and keeps the canonical unresolved capability backlog empty
  - `ASE-15`, `ASE-34`, `ASE-44`, `ASE-45`, `ASE-47`, and `ASE-48` are all already `Done`

The committed `artifacts/release/*.json` bundle should not be treated as the exact-head source of truth for this audit:

- those committed files still reflect the earlier local metadata flow around `f252ece41036e61f47f6b7882684c3acba59861b`
- the exact-head source of truth is the repo-hosted Release workflow run `24024875591`

## Decision

Decision: `NO-GO` for the first trusted release of `svelte-streamdown@3.0.1`.

Reasoning:

1. The strict-closeout backlog itself is now actually closed.
   The reviewed docs show `Partial local coverage = 0`, the canonical unresolved capability backlog is empty, and all upstream strict-closeout tickets required by `ASE-46` are already complete.
2. The exact reviewed head has fresh repo-hosted CI and Release workflow evidence.
   GitHub Actions runs `24024875608` and `24024875591` both passed on `master@7ef35ae4a6f992ccd454b2233ae7ca70fb64dedf`, so the repo-hosted release-hardening and provenance paths are current for the reviewed head.
3. The trusted-release blockers recorded in repository policy still stand.
   `pnpm verify:dependency-policy` passes because advisory `1115805` is reviewed, but both `config/dependency-policy.json` and `docs/release-policy.md` still classify that advisory as blocking the first trusted release; `CHANGELOG.md` also still lacks the required `3.0.1` entry.
4. A future parity-backed `GO` call still needs a fresh exact-head nightly run.
   The latest green nightly run is on `833200338632d68029b5a25b1898ecd48b173e1d`, and the later diff to `7ef35ae` includes parser/rendering closeout changes, so the nightly evidence is no longer exact-head parity proof for this post-closeout candidate.

## Platform Status Alignment

- `ASE-15`, `ASE-34`, `ASE-44`, `ASE-45`, `ASE-47`, and `ASE-48` are already `Done`, and that now matches the landed strict-closeout evidence tree.
- `ASE-46` is the only remaining non-`Done` ticket in this chain, and it exists solely to land this final documentation/platform synchronization before the workflow can close the tree cleanly.

## Re-Audit Trigger

Run the next release review only after all of the following are true:

1. The reviewed `lodash-es` production advisory is removed from the shipped graph, or a later reviewed policy decision explicitly reclassifies it as non-blocking for the first trusted release.
2. The release candidate version in `package.json` has a matching changelog entry before the publish workflow is used for a trusted release.
3. The repo-hosted nightly parity workflow is rerun successfully on the exact post-closeout head, or on a later reviewed candidate head whose parity-sensitive diff is explicitly re-audited.
