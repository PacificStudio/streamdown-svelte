# Release Readiness Report

This document records the `ASE-21` final unresolved-gap summary and refreshed release readiness audit for `svelte-streamdown`.

Audit date: `2026-04-04`

Supersedes:

- the prior `P5-05` audit captured in this file on `2026-04-03`

Audit target:

- Repository: `BetterAndBetterII/svelte-streamdown`
- Release candidate branch/head reviewed: `master@a6b7f897243b3669137324398c9dcb9addd9a66e`
- Frozen parity target: `vercel/streamdown@5f6475139a87dee8af08fcf7b01475292bc064d2`
- Tracking issue: `#87`

## Evidence Reviewed

- Roadmap, parity contract, and backlog state:
  - `PLAN.md`
  - `docs/parity-contract.md`
  - `docs/parity-matrix.md`
  - `docs/test-migration-status.md`
- Release policy and workflow definitions:
  - `docs/release-policy.md`
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/nightly-full-parity.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- Refreshed parity and release artifacts committed in the repository:
  - `artifacts/nightly/summary/summary.md`
  - `artifacts/nightly/ported-tests/summary.md`
  - `artifacts/nightly/playwright-parity/summary.md`
  - `artifacts/nightly/pack-smoke/summary.md`
  - `artifacts/nightly/dependency-audit/summary.md`
  - `artifacts/release/build-metadata.json`
  - `artifacts/release/artifact-metadata.json`
  - `artifacts/release/provenance-metadata.json`
- Current GitHub Actions evidence gathered on `2026-04-04`:
  - `gh run list --workflow "CI" --limit 5`
  - `gh run list --workflow "Nightly Full Parity" --limit 5`
  - `gh run list --workflow "Release" --limit 5`
  - `gh run view 23970111865 --json url,jobs,headSha,displayTitle,event,conclusion,createdAt,updatedAt`
- Local re-audit commands run from this workspace on `2026-04-04`:
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm check`
  - `pnpm test`
  - `pnpm build`
  - `pnpm verify:toolchain`
  - `pnpm verify:test-migration-status`
  - `pnpm verify:pack`
  - `pnpm verify:exports`
  - `pnpm verify:dependency-policy`
  - `pnpm verify:release-metadata`
  - `pnpm verify:clean-build`
  - `pnpm verify:api-surface`
- Local audit setup note:
  - the OpenASE harness omits `references/streamdown/**` by default, so the frozen upstream reference tree was checked out locally at `5f64751` before rerunning `pnpm verify:api-surface` and the affected contract suite

## Refresh Since The 2026-04-03 Audit

- The exact current `master` head now has fresh green GitHub CI evidence:
  - push run `23970111865` completed successfully on `2026-04-04` for `master@a6b7f897243b3669137324398c9dcb9addd9a66e`
- The repo now contains a refreshed committed nightly artifact bundle:
  - `artifacts/nightly/summary/summary.md` reports overall `success` at `2026-04-04T03:01:09.427Z`
  - the committed suite summaries for `ported-tests`, `playwright-parity`, `pack-smoke`, and `dependency-audit` are all green
- The API-surface and parser contract evidence is materially better than in the prior audit:
  - with the frozen reference tree present, `pnpm verify:api-surface` passed locally
  - `tests/contracts/parser-ir.spec.ts` and `tests/contracts/parser-parity.spec.ts` passed locally once the missing reference tree was restored
- `docs/parity-matrix.md` now treats package/export-boundary and plugin-boundary differences as explicit `different_by_design` drift instead of leaving them as implicit implementation debt

The refreshed evidence narrows the release risk to a smaller and clearer set of remaining blockers, but it does not clear the release.

## Current Evidence Snapshot

### Parity And Migration State

`docs/parity-matrix.md` now makes the remaining state explicit instead of mixing accepted drift with implementation debt:

- accepted drift:
  - package/export boundaries
  - plugin-contract and standalone-package boundaries
- release-blocking backlog:
  - parser
  - security
  - rendering
  - interactions

`docs/test-migration-status.md` currently reports:

- `101` executable frozen reference files
- `13` files passing via ported upstream file
- `7` files passing with documented port gap
- `11` files passing via local analogue only
- `44` files with partial local coverage
- `5` files with missing local coverage
- `21` files blocked by missing surface
- `4` remaining `P0` files not yet passing via a ported upstream file or local analogue

### GitHub Actions State

Latest current-head push run:

- Workflow: `CI`
- Run id: `23970111865`
- Head: `master@a6b7f897243b3669137324398c9dcb9addd9a66e`
- Created: `2026-04-04T03:11:32Z`
- Updated: `2026-04-04T03:13:19Z`
- Result: `success`

Jobs confirmed green in that run:

- `verify-test-migration-status`
- `verify-toolchain`
- `verify-clean-build`
- `verify-pack`
- `verify-exports`
- `verify-dependency-policy`
- `verify-api-surface`
- `verify-release-metadata`
- `report-coverage`

Other workflow observations gathered on `2026-04-04`:

- `gh run list --workflow "Nightly Full Parity"` returned no GitHub-hosted runs
- `gh run list --workflow "Release"` returned no runs
- the workflow files do exist in the repository, so this is an execution-history gap, not a missing-file gap

## Decision

Decision: `NO-GO` for a trusted release and `NO-GO` for a parity-backed release claim.

Reasoning:

1. Parity evidence is refreshed, but the remaining backlog is still explicitly release-blocking.
   `docs/parity-matrix.md` still carries open parser, security, rendering, and interaction backlog rows, and `docs/test-migration-status.md` still shows unresolved `P0`, partial, missing, and blocked files.
2. Baseline quality gates are still not green on the reviewed commit.
   `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` both fail during this audit, even after the missing-reference harness issue was removed from the test path.
3. Trusted release policy still lacks end-to-end workflow evidence.
   No `Release` workflow run exists to inspect, and the policy-required `lint-and-format`, `typecheck`, `unit-tests`, `build-package`, `publish-with-provenance`, and `post-publish-verify` jobs are not yet evidenced as matching required release jobs.
4. Dependency and license exceptions remain explicitly temporary.
   The dependency-policy gate is green only because the current exceptions are approved for later removal or re-review before the first trusted release.

## Exit Criteria For The Next Re-Audit

Re-run release review only after all of the following are true:

1. The remaining parser, security, rendering, and interaction backlog rows in `docs/parity-matrix.md` are either closed with evidence or formally reclassified in the compatibility contract.
2. `docs/test-migration-status.md` no longer reports unresolved `P0` files and has materially reduced the current `partial` / `missing` / `blocked` inventory.
3. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm build` are all green on the exact candidate release commit.
4. GitHub workflow evidence exists for the release policy itself, not just the `verify-*` subset:
   - a completed `Release` workflow run is available for audit
   - the required release jobs in `docs/release-policy.md` are implemented and reviewable as actual enforced workflow gates
5. Approved dependency and license exceptions are removed or explicitly re-reviewed with a written decision that they no longer block the first trusted release.
