## What Changed Since The Prior Audit

- The reviewed `master` head advanced from `9b1b513ad0801af5b2c2737048b881a00b9f3818` to `850b5ab5f3f1d7a99aa44fb0ca1d6f168f282d84`.
- The exact reviewed head now has fresh green repo-hosted CI evidence:
  - push run `23982213956` completed successfully on `2026-04-04`
- The exact reviewed head now also has fresh green repo-hosted Release workflow evidence:
  - push run `23982213953` completed successfully on `2026-04-04`
  - `prepare-release`, `publish-with-provenance`, and `post-publish-verify` all completed successfully
  - actual npm publish and tag creation were intentionally skipped because this was a push run, not `workflow_dispatch` with `publish=true`
- The previous repo-hosted nightly blocker is closed:
  - `Nightly Full Parity` run `23981223900` completed successfully on `2026-04-04`
  - that green nightly run reviewed commit `4dbd7b339a58f0ca349ba18d2330a5da50edbe33`
- The current nightly evidence is still materially representative of the reviewed head.
  - Inference: `git diff --name-only 4dbd7b3..850b5ab` shows only release-workflow, release-artifact, release-doc, and release-script changes after the green nightly run; no shipped runtime, parser, or parity-test files changed in that range.
- The migration tracker no longer reports unresolved `P0` or missing reference files:
  - `docs/test-migration-status.md` now reports `54` files passing via ported upstream file, `12` with documented port gaps, and `16` via local analogue only
  - the remaining unresolved inventory is down to `3` partial files, `0` missing files, `16` blocked files, and `0` remaining `P0` files not yet passing via a ported upstream file or local analogue
- The platform closeout tree is now closed through `ASE-42`:
  - `ASE-15`, `ASE-34`, and `ASE-35` through `ASE-42` are all already `Done`

| Production dependency advisory `1115805` (`lodash-es` via `mermaid@11.11.0`) | `still blocking trusted release` | `config/dependency-policy.json`, `docs/dependency-policy.md`, `docs/release-policy.md`, and `pnpm verify:dependency-policy` output | The repository's own reviewed policy still says not to cut the first trusted release until the shipped graph no longer resolves `lodash-es < 4.18.0`, even though the gate records the advisory as an approved exception. |
| Release checklist input mismatch for `svelte-streamdown@3.0.1`               | `still blocking trusted release` | `package.json` is `3.0.1`, but `CHANGELOG.md` has no `3.0.1` section and there is no matching tag in the repository                | The current candidate still fails the documented release-input checklist before a trusted publish can start.                                                                                                              |

No separate repo-hosted nightly, migration, or release-workflow evidence blocker remains in the current evidence set.

The committed `artifacts/release/*.json` bundle should not be treated as the exact-head source of truth for this audit:

- those committed files still reflect the earlier local metadata flow around `f252ece41036e61f47f6b7882684c3acba59861b`
- the exact-head source of truth is the repo-hosted Release workflow run `23982213953`

## Decision

Decision: `NO-GO` for the first trusted release of `svelte-streamdown@3.0.1`.

Reasoning:

1. The stale blockers from the previous audit are now closed.
   The reviewed head has fresh green repo-hosted CI and Release workflow runs, the latest repo-hosted nightly parity run is green, and the migration tracker no longer reports unresolved `P0` or missing files.
2. The remaining dependency-policy blocker is still explicit in the repository's own reviewed policy.
   `pnpm verify:dependency-policy` passes because the production advisory is formally recorded, but both `config/dependency-policy.json` and `docs/release-policy.md` still classify that same advisory as blocking the first trusted release.
3. The current versioned release inputs are not complete.
   `package.json` is already at `3.0.1`, but the required matching changelog entry is missing from `CHANGELOG.md`, so the release checklist is not yet satisfied for the candidate version.
4. The current `NO-GO` is not a parity-evidence failure.
   The latest green nightly parity run plus the zero-`P0` / zero-missing migration tracker mean the parity side of the prior release audit is no longer the reason this closeout stays red.

## Platform Status Alignment

- `ASE-15` and `ASE-34` are already `Done`, and that is now consistent with the completed child tree beneath them.
- `ASE-43` is the only remaining open closeout ticket in this chain; after this document synchronization lands, no further umbrella-status correction is needed.

## Re-Audit Trigger

Run the next release review only after both of the following are true:

1. The reviewed `lodash-es` production advisory is removed from the shipped graph, or a later reviewed policy decision explicitly reclassifies it as non-blocking for the first trusted release.
2. The release candidate version in `package.json` has a matching changelog entry before the publish workflow is used for a trusted release.
