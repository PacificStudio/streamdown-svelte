# Svelte Streamdown Parity Plan

## Document Purpose

This document turns the high-level roadmap into an execution plan that can be tracked issue by issue.

Primary goals:

1. Trusted, reproducible, secure releases
2. Ported test coverage from the reference `streamdown`
3. Interface-level and browser-level parity testing against the reference implementation
4. Full functional parity with the reference `streamdown` and its supported feature set

This plan assumes the reference target is the code currently stored in `references/streamdown`.

## Execution Rules

- Do not implement parity changes without first defining the expected behavior in tests or parity fixtures.
- Do not "adapt the tests to the implementation" unless the difference is explicitly marked as intentional.
- Every parity-related PR must update the parity matrix and reference the issue ID it closes.
- Every bug fix must add or update a regression test.
- Release work is not complete unless it is enforceable in CI.

## Tracking Model

Issue statuses:

- `todo`
- `in_progress`
- `blocked`
- `done`

Recommended labels:

- `phase:0` to `phase:5`
- `area:release`
- `area:security`
- `area:tests`
- `area:parity`
- `area:parser`
- `area:rendering`
- `area:interactivity`
- `area:docs`

### Issue P6-01: Close Remaining Parity Gaps

- Status: `in_progress`

### Issue P6-03: Close Remaining Alignment And Release Blockers

- Status: `in_progress`
- Goal: Convert every still-open closeout misalignment from the `2026-04-04` re-audit into an explicit execution ticket, separate work that can run in parallel from work that must wait on earlier evidence, and keep `PLAN.md`, platform state, and release-readiness evidence aligned.
- Deliverables:
- execution tickets `ASE-35` through `ASE-43`
- dependency ordering that distinguishes immediately-runnable work from evidence-blocked follow-up work
- `docs/release-readiness-report.md` execution mapping aligned with the platform ticket tree
- Acceptance:
- every remaining gap family from the `2026-04-04` re-audit is mapped to a concrete execution ticket
- the dependency chain from implementation work to evidence refresh to final status synchronization is explicit
- the next closeout pass can start from this plan without hidden work

#### P6-03 Execution Order

1. Run the independent implementation and policy tracks in parallel: `ASE-35`, `ASE-36`, `ASE-38`, and `ASE-40`.
2. Once the remaining surface work lands, close the evidence gaps that depend on it: `ASE-37` and `ASE-39`.
3. Rebuild repo-hosted nightly parity evidence on the reviewed head through `ASE-41`.
4. After nightly evidence, lint hygiene, baseline tests, and dependency decisions agree, produce repo-hosted release provenance in `ASE-42`.
5. Only after the blocker tickets above are truly closed, perform final document and platform status synchronization in `ASE-43`.
